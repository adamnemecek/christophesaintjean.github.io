### This repository gives some educational/research materials through documented code:
* IPython Notebooks
* Matlab source code

Some ideas to be implemented:
* Clifford Fourier Transform
* Rotations in $R^2$, $R^3$, $R^4$, $R^n$
* Classical linear algebra algorithms and the GA counterpart
* Power iteration method
